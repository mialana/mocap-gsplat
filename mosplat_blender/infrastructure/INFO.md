# Infrastructure Module

This module contains implementation of concepts that focus on native Python best practices.
It avoids import of Blender structures, and instead focuses on supporting the add-on
through good typed Pythonic practices (emphasis on the _typed_).

And since I want to focus on learning and practicing these best practices in this module,
I've tried to comment all implemented classes and functions --
equally to explain the implementation and assure myself that I am using the Python concept correctly.
